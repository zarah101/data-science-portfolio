# Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio - a collection of projects that reflect my curiosity, analytical thinking, and practical experience across data exploration, machine learning, and visualization. Each project highlights a different part of my skill set, from working with messy real-world datasets to building predictive models and creating interactive visuals.

## Projects

### Creative Greeting with Python
A simple, interactive script that uses Python visualizations to add a personal touch to the portfolio. It was a fun way to combine basic scripting with Matplotlib to generate a dynamic greeting and chart display.
- Tech: Python, Matplotlib, Seaborn

### World Happiness Report - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This project explores what drives happiness across countries using the World Happiness Report datasets.
What’s inside:
- Data cleaning and feature exploration
- Choropleth maps (2015 & 2019) to visualize global patterns
- Correlation analysis between GDP, life expectancy, social support, etc.
- Visual breakdowns of score distributions and trends
- Tech: Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly

### Fraud Detection Model
This project builds a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions in an imbalanced dataset (0.17% fraud). The workflow includes data preprocessing, undersampling, model training (e.g., Random Forest), and evaluation using metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score.

Key Results
- Accuracy: 91.37%
- Precision: 97.94%
- Recall: 86.36%
- F1 Score: 91.79%

Technologies used: Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib), Models (Random Forest)

### Isolation Forest - Anomaly Scores
An unsupervised learning approach to detecting anomalies in credit card data.
Key steps:
- Explored data structure and confirmed no missing values
- Reviewed severe class imbalance (99.83% non-fraud vs. 0.17% fraud)
- Applied Isolation Forest to obtain anomaly scores
- Removed the most anomalous 10% for comparison
- Visualized distributions before/after outlier filtering
- Tech: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
