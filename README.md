# Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

This repository showcases my creative approach to data science projects, including Python-based visualizations and fun interactive elements. Check out my project where I greet visitors with a colorful chart that demonstrates my data analysis and visualization skills!

## Projects

### Creative Greeting with Python
- A fun interactive Python script that greets visitors and displays a colorful chart showcasing my skills.
- Technologies used: Python, Matplotlib, Seaborn

### World Happiness Report - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This project analyzes the World Happiness Report dataset, exploring factors that contribute to happiness across countries. The analysis includes data cleaning, visualization, and insights on how various factors (e.g., GDP, social support) impact happiness scores.

- Choropleth Maps: Interactive maps for 2015 and 2019 to visualize happiness scores by country.
- Correlation Analysis: Insights into the relationships between factors like life expectancy, GDP, and happiness scores.
- Visualizations: Various plots to explore happiness score distributions, country comparisons, and trends over the years.
- Technologies Used: Python, Seaborn/Matplotlib, Plotly

### Fraud Detection Model
This project builds a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions in an imbalanced dataset (0.17% fraud). The workflow includes data preprocessing, undersampling, model training (e.g., Random Forest), and evaluation using metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score.

Key Results
- Accuracy: 91.37%
- Precision: 97.94%
- Recall: 86.36%
- F1 Score: 91.79%

Technologies used: Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib), Models (Random Forest)
